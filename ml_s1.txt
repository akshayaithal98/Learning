Types of learning algorithms:
1.supervised learning:give features as well as labels for model to learn.
				ex:give features and provide names of fruits
	Regression(dependent variable y is continuos).
	Classification(Y is discrete).Ex:spam or not
	cluster analysis
	etc
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

Data needs to be divided into 2 parts:
Train data set- train your model 
Test data set- check it using test data and understand
		 its ability /performance

then calculate performance of model

Take data
data exploration
Preprocess
Split into train/test
modelling
test the model
measure the performance metrics

Supervised learning algorithms:
linear regression(regression)
and all below for classification:
logistics regression
naive bayes classification
knn
decision tree

Unsupervised learning:no labels will be given.only features are given
K-means clustering
hierarchical clustering
density based clustering

reinforcement:based on reward and punishment. just like traing dog.
 

if percentage of null values is less then dont drop
handling missing values:
deleting of rows
mean/median/mode
forward and backward filling
imputations based like seeing its neighbours.ex:knn impuation

feature engineering: 

categorical variables need to converted to numerical. for that we can use
label encoding(done alphabetically),one hot encoding/creating dummies(
create extra features/variables to encode,
it creates boolean columns for each categorical value)

feature reduction/selection-take only important features for modelling.one way is 
by correlation matrix(most used),forward selection,missing value ratio

feature extraction-generating new features from given feature.
like extracting oil from groundnut
new features carry essence of given features
done by
pca,lda algorithms etc

70:30 ratio for training:testing splitting
actual-predicted=error

feature scaling:
standardization(0 mean and unit SD by z transformation),value btw -1 to 1,
normalization for uniformity .otherwise it badly affects models.
one column may be small like marks and other very high like salary .this is highly scaled.
 so make uniformity btw two.
one column may be given weightage because of high value without feature scaling
normalization or min max normalization:feature-min/(max-min). 
it reduces value to btw 0-1

Semi supervised learning  is where u provide labels to only some and rest will be filled automatically.
deep learning-subset of machine learning where algorithms works on neuron and huge data is required
reinforcement learning -ex:self driving cars

pruning is not done in rf
